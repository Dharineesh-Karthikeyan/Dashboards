# Dashboards
A portfolio showcasing some of the dashboards I've crafted throughout my academic journey.


> **"I hold the view that an effective dashboard is not characterized by excessive design elements, vibrant colors, or a multitude of graph types. Instead, a valuable dashboard is one that presents information in a straightforward manner, allowing the reader to quickly glean the desired insights with a simple glance."**


***Note:***
These dashboards have been designed in accordance with the academic assignment specifications, ensuring that all the specified requirements are met and considered essential for the dashboard's completion.
